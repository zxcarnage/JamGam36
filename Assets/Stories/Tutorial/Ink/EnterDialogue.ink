It's night. Again. Сan't sun shine forever? #speaker:son
It can't. Now it shines for another.#speaker:mom
But, what should we do? It's dark here...#speaker:son
You mature enough, to understand. Not only sun can give light. Once, I saw a miracle : light deep in the night dark. Since then, I’ve been going there day after day. #speaker:mom
Can you show me?#speaker:son
I think you are ready. Follow me.#speaker:mom
